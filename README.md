# LoggingExample
Just a quick and simple example of how I did basic logging for a project using ASP.Net MVC, Javascript, Linq, and a bit of SQL

For the flow of data and naming conventions I try to emulate as best I can what the project I'm on is already doing so that if any other devlopers look at it they are on the same page with one another and know what the code is doing.
